## **HUMAN ACTIVITY DETECTION USING SMARTPHONE SENSORS**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to detect human activities using sensor data. The project leverages data from wearable devices or other sensors to classify various physical activities based on their unique patterns.

### **Project Overview**
The main objective of this project is to use sensor data to classify human activities into predefined categories. The dataset comprises sensor readings such as accelerometer and gyroscope data collected during different activities.

### **Key Features**
**Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and preprocess raw sensor data.

**Feature Engineering:** Extraction and selection of features relevant to activity classification.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** Training machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

**Visualization:** Insights and visualizations to better understand the dataset and model results.
